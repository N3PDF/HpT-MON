We point out that the resummation formulae that are usually used to compute the distributions in perturbative QCD involve process-dependent form factors and coefficient functions. We present a new universal form of the resummed distribution, in which the dependence on the process is embodied in a single perturbative factor. The new form simplifies the calculation of non-leading logarithms at higher perturbative orders. It can also be useful to systematically implement process-independent non-perturbative effects in transverse-momentum distributions. We also comment on the dependence of these distributions on the factorization and renormalization scales. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In this PhD thesis, we analyze and generalize the renormalization group approach to the resummation of large logarithms in the perturbative expansion due to soft and collinear multiparton emissions. In particular, we present a generalization of this approach to prompt photon production. It is interesting to see that also with the more intricate two-scale kinematics that characterizes prompt photon production in the soft limit, it remains true that resummation simply follows from general kine-matic properties of the phase space. Also, this approach does not require a separate treatment of individual colour structures when more than one colour structure contributes to fixed order results. However, the resummation formulae obtained here turn out to be less predictive than previous results: this depends on the fact that here neither specific factorization properties of the cross section in the soft limit is assumed, nor that soft emission satisfies eikonal-like relations. We also derive resuma-tion formulae to all logarithmic accuracy and valid for all values of rapidity for the prompt photon production and the Drell-Yan rapidity distributions. We show that for the fixed-target experiment E866/NuSea, the NLL resummation corrections are comparable to NLO fixed-order corrections and are crucial to obtain agreement with the data. Finally we outline also possible future applications of the renormalization group approach.},

abstract = {This thesis arises in the context of precision measurements at hadron colliders. The Tevatron and the LHC provide very accurate measurements of many Standard Model processes, such as the production of a lepton pair (Drell-Yan) of high invariant mass. An accurate theoretical prediction of such processes is crucial to be able to distinguish Standard Model physics from possible new physics signals. QCD effects in the computation of the cross-sections at hadron colliders are usually sizable; in particular, in some kinematical regimes they behave in a non-perturbative way. In these cases the resummation of the whole perturbative series is needed for accurate phenomenological predictions. In this thesis the impact of threshold and high-energy resummations for the production of high invariant mass systems (Drell-Yan, Higgs) are studied in detail. In particular, in the threshold case a prescription to deal with the divergent nature of the perturbative series based on Borel summation is presented, and compared with the other prescriptions in the literature. Results for the invariant mass distributions and rapidity distributions are presented. The high-energy resummation formalism is reviewed and improved, and its impact in phenomenological applications at hadron colliders is investigated. In particular, a possible interaction between the two resummation regimes is studied in some detail.},

abstract = {We present a phenomenological application of the joint resummation formalism to elec-troweak annihilation processes at measured boson momentum Q T. This formalism simultaneously resums at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy large threshold and recoil corrections to partonic scattering. We invert the impact parameter transform using a previously described analytic continuation procedure. This leads to a well-defined, resummed pertur-bative cross section for all nonzero Q T , which can be compared to resummation carried out directly in Q T space. From the structure of the resummed expressions, we also determine the form of nonperturbative corrections to the cross section and implement these into our analysis. We obtain a good description of the transverse momentum distribution of Z bosons produced at the Tevatron collider.},

abstract = {We consider the production of the Standard Model Higgs boson through the gluon fusion mechanism in hadron collisions. We present the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD result of the hard-collinear coefficient function for the all-order resummation of logarithmically-enhanced contributions at small transverse momentum. The coefficient function controls NNLO contributions in resummed calculations at full next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The same coefficient function is used in applications of the subtraction method to perform fully-exclusive perturbative calculations up to NNLO.},

@techreport{DeFlorian2005,
abstract = {We study the resummation of large logarithmic QCD corrections for the process pp → H + X when the Higgs boson H is produced at high transverse momentum. The corrections arise near the threshold for partonic reaction and originate from soft gluon emission. We perform the all-order resummation at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and match the resummed result with the next-to-leading order perturbative predictions. The effect of resummation on the Higgs transverse momentum distribution at the LHC is discussed.},

@article{Rabemananjara2020,
abstract = {We study the phenomenological impact of a recently suggested formalism for the combination of threshold and a so-called threshold-improved transverse momentum resummation, by using it to improve the fixed-order results. This formalism allows for a systematic improvement of the transverse momentum resummation that is valid in the entire range of $p_T$ by the inclusion of the threshold contribution. We use the Borel method as a suitable prescription for defining the inverse Mellin and Fourier transforms in the context of combined resummed expression. The study is applied to two QCD processes, namely the Higgs boson produced via gluon fusion and $Z$ boson production via the Drell--Yan mechanism. We compare our results to the standard transverse momentum resummation, as well as to the fixed-order results. We find that the threshold-improved transverse momentum resummation leads to faster perturbative convergence at small $p_T$ while the inclusion of threshold resummation improves the agreement with fixed-order calculations at medium and large $p_T$. These effects are more pronounced in the case of Higgs which is known to have slower perturbative convergence.},

@article{Muselli2017,
abstract = {We present a combined resummation for the transverse momentum distribution of a colorless final state in perturbative QCD, expressed as a function of transverse momentum p T and the scaling variable x. Its expression satisfies three requirements: it reduces to standard transverse momentum resummation to any desired logarithmic order in the limit p T → 0 for fixed x, up to power suppressed corrections in p T ; it reduces to threshold resummation to any desired logarithmic order in the limit x → 1 for fixed p T , up to power suppressed correction in 1 − x; upon integration over transverse momentum it reproduces the resummation of the total cross cross at any given logarithmic order in the threshold x → 1 limit, up to power suppressed correction in 1 − x. Its main ingredient, and our main new result, is a modified form of transverse momentum resummation, which leads to threshold resummation upon integration over p T , and for which we provide a simple closed-form analytic expression in Fourier-Mellin (b, N) space. We give explicit coefficients up to NNLL order for the specific case of Higgs production in gluon fusion in the effective field theory limit. Our result allows for a systematic improvement of the transverse momentum distribution through threshold resummation which holds for all p T , and elucidates the relation between transverse momentum resummation and threshold resummation at the inclusive level, specifically by providing within perturbative QCD a simple derivation of the main consequence of the so-called collinear anomaly of SCET.},
